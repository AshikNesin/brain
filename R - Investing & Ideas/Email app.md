I think what's interesting for [cal.com](http://cal.com/) is that it could get embedded in other products based on OSS which could serve as adistribution layer, could work for people in the enterprise given the OSS stuff but perhaps reluctance of sysadmins to give calendly access to your calendar, + the fact that calendly's product velocity has been kind of crap. Calendly is *the* game in town to disrupt so you are going OSS versus calendly and have to decide if that vector gives you enough advantages to give it a go. I think it might but not sure… Calendly does have [an enterprise offering](https://calendly.com/for-enterprise), though, and I haven't done the work to fully opine.  

  

The challenge versus Mailchimp/ConvertKit, etc. is that there are multiple big businesses in this space already so you need a significant distribution advantage versus many of them. [Ghost](https://github.com/tryghost) (or [ListMonk](https://listmonk.app/)) competes with these people a little and I think is a good business but not sure if they will hit venture scale as you mentioned. They are also kind of vanilla SaaS businesses so enterprises can adopt them whether or not OSS given the lack of "infrastructure integration" (which tends to be where enterprises get very scared.)
