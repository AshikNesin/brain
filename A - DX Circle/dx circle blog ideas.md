### devrel, dev evangelism
https://thenewstack.io/devrel-and-the-increasing-popularity-of-the-developer-advocate/


1. How do you measure success?
2. How hard is it to go back to full time engineering?
3. How do you choose what to work on? (blogging, internal evangelism, conferences, demos)
4. How important is experience with the technology you’re evangelizing?
5. What do you look for when choosing a role?
6. Why would someone consider DevRel over engineering?



### developer content trade school
- art of software gets less traction
- than how to React in 2021
- The fundamental problem of developer content creation: "How to do React in 2021" gets 100x more views than "How to write software so you can maintain it for 10 years".
- The fundamental solution? write one paper with main thesis and then apply it a billion times

- things you can try
	- build demo app
		- jamie from convex - "look at us get a thing done"
		- generate blogpost
			- "how we mapped game state"
			- X without Y category

### a modest proposal for developer experience

lace everything with cocaine

### hard problems working on platforms
- stability work is zero value by default, justification comes from hard-to-reverse damage whereas feature work is overstated
- want to keep growing by adding features, but vast majority of users will just use three
- users you want to reach dont appreciate the problem you solve
- you want to commoditize complements/be switzerland but your users want a clear community
- extensibility and plugins - first x then y
- open source - users and operators
- multiple compile destinations
	- xbrowser difficulties https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1505401925184991235?s=21
	- lowest common denominators 
- https://skamille.medium.com/product-for-internal-platforms-9205c3a08142
	- But the platform team doesn’t build solutions for only one user. The whole value of a platform team is providing broadly-useful systems, so we are rarely presented with a well-specified need to fill.
	-  In a perfect world, platform product managers are regularly using the products they support in order to identify pain points and gaps that engineers might miss and users may not complain about. In the real world it’s hard to find time to use your products in anger when you are also dealing with all the other parts of the PM job.

## growing UGC at devtools
- job postings
- case studies
- blogposts
- tweets

## devtools uncanny valley
- either small api surface area
- or extremely opinionated all in one
- in between require too much work for the value or are not flexible enough

## marketing to developers

- answer what's the catch
- hook into known hard problems eg cap theorem

## selling a programming paradigm
- fp vs oop
- sql vs nosql
- jamstack
- devops


## things developers want
- performance
- cost
- "scale"
- simplicity
