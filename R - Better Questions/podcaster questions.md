## question styles

Never ask a yes/no question. Don't ask "Are you satisfied with your current provider?" rather "What do you like/dislike about your current provider?". The wrong answer to a yes/no question ends the conversation.

Favor interrogative-led questions over leading Questions. A leading question attempts to get the listener to agree or disagree with a premise you feed to them. An interrogative-led question often begins with the words: who; where; what; when; why.

Imagine the responses to these two questions:
- "Did you like the movie?" (Leading)
- "What did you think about the movie?" (Interrogative-led)
