1. HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT YOUR LIFE AT WORK? Why this works: This question makes them feel seen and heard as people, not employees. As a leader, you also get critical context on how to support them at work.
2. 2. HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT YOUR WORK-FROM-HOME SET UP? Why this works: If you are even partially remote, this helps you understand if there are any productivity blockers. You’ll find out if there are any inexpensive items that could make a difference.
3. 3. HOW ARE WE PERFORMING AS A COMPANY? Why this works: You get an assessment of company performance against THEIR expectations. Their ideas about how the company could do better enters the conversation.
4. 4. WHAT IS IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THE REST OF THE TEAM? Why this works: The day-to-day of what it feels like to be on your team gets a chance to be expressed. The good and bad of team dynamics get the attention it deserves.
5. 5. WHAT IS IT LIKE TO WORK WITH ME? Why this works: Most managers don’t know what it feels like to report to them. You get direct feedback about what it is like to be in their shoes to work with you.
6. After each of these questions, it's critical to ask: “What would get it to the next level?” Most people have great ideas on how to improve things when asked in a structured way.
