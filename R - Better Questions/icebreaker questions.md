Instead of ‘how are you?’ - ‘What’s been in your tabs lately?’ ‘What’s something you’re looking forward to or something you’ve been dealing with?’ ‘What’s been on your mind that you want to talk about?’ ‘What do you do or don’t want to talk about today?’

Instead of asking “what do you do?“, a more standard question when meeting someone should be “In what ways are you weird?” or “what’s broken about you?” - Alain de Botton. Alain runs the School of Life, 

instead of “hows it going” - “you look happy what were you doing before this?” or “what did you get for breakfast!” https://overcast.fm/+rTsWu_yOc
