	- In the beginning of our story, back in the '70s, there were [Codd's rules,](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-in-a/9780596155322/ch01s01s01.html) defining what we now call "[relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database)", also known today as "databases". You know them, even if you don't: all data lives in tables; tables have columns, and rows are addressable with keys; C.R.U.D.; schemas; a textual language to convey these concepts. The language, of course, is SQL, which prompted a Cambrian explosion of SQL databases, from Oracle to DB2 to Postgres to MySQL, throughout the '80s and '90s.
	- It hasn't all been good. The 2000s got us XML databases. But our industry atoned by building some [great columnar databases](https://www.vertica.com/secrets-behind-verticas-performance/) during the same time. By the 2010s, we saw dozens of large-scale, open-source distributed database projects come to market. Now anyone can spin up a cluster and query terabytes of data.
	- First came the database tier. Later, with [memcached](https://memcached.org/) and [Redis](https://fly.io/blog/all-in-on-sqlite-litestream/redis.io), we got the caching tier. We've got [background job tiers](https://sidekiq.org/) and we've got [routing tiers](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) and distribution tiers.
