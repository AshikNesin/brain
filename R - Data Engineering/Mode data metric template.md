TEMPLATE: Metric Overview

From Emily Ritter's dbt coalesce 2022 talk

  

Metric

Give it a simple name

  

Why this metric? Why now?

Share some context on why this metric is important for your business unit.

  

What are the follow-on questions we’ll want to answer once we have this metric defined?

Add commentary on the things you may want to cut this metric by - time grains, cohort commentary, regions, segments, product SKUs or categories, channel, source, etc. Imagine yourself exploring this metric – what’s the thing you’d quickly come back and say “ooh but what about…” Next, imagine yourself sharing a report based on this metric with someone else. What level of detail might they ask you about? Example: let’s say you decide to use the dbt Semantic Layer to measure Cost per Lead (CPL). Your CMO sees it’s going up and she wants to know why. Will you be able to answer?

  

Where does this data live today?

Where do you look at these metrics now? Are there multiple sources that don’t match? Our goal with this step (likely a collaborative effort between data teams and business teams) is to figure out if data sources need to get ELT’ed into the warehouse before building the metric. Are there ways you’re going to want to blend contextual data from one tool to the next (think: structured/unstructured filters you may want to apply to this data)?

  

What is your current definition of this metric?

Is there a source of truth somewhere that explains in plain English what this metric means to you? Is the definition accurate? Have other stakeholders validated it?

  

What’s one thing about this metric definition that might not be obvious on the surface?

Think: nuances of how customers use a feature that differs in non-obvious ways, business processes that might not be clear in the definition but are helpful context, etc.

  

Who else does this metric matter to? 

Who “owns it” from a KPI standpoint? Do they need to be involved in our iteration process? Who is the final signoff on the definition of this metric?

  

How often should we plan to review the definition of this metric?

  
  

What’s your deadline? What’s driving the urgency?
