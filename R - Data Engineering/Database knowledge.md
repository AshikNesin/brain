bigquery https://overcast.fm/+5PHEijBNg 
- bigquery had separation of storage and compute first before snowflake
- data sharing - globally addressable data so stuff is not siloed
- active data warehouse is under 100gb
- snowflake vs redshift was 30tb but only large custs do that
- 90% queries under 100mb

3 types of data (vinoth hudi)
- postgres - mutability
- event stream - support deduplication - high scale
- api - smaller scale, but high variety - salesforce, hubspot etc


large tech co
- CDC streams 
	- flink stream processing
	- send to CDW
- flexible between batch and stream
- fivetran - lock this stream in - not possible to get stream out into kafka topic
- onehouse focuses on actual storage management
	- gave up query layer - have people who ran presto for 2.5 yrs

## Mysql vs Postgres
https://twitter.com/mscccc/status/1476246801174966272?s=20
- MySQL - simpler, easier to operate, backups, replication, failover, upgrades (infra engs like)
- Postgres - postgis, jsonb, hstore (product engs like)

https://percona.podbean.com/e/all-things-open-source-database-advocacy-and-alloydb-percona-database-podcast-76-w-gabe-weiss/
- some people dont like oracle tech
- postgres truly vendor neutral  - more supportive of plugins like alloydb - googleâ€™s scalable postgres backend
-  turns postgres into HTAP - 45mins in - analytics stuff on postgres

Why planetscale not postgres
- https://twitter.com/rbranson/status/1461031251691773953
- Both Postgres and MySQL not addressing needs like schema evolution, data migrations, understanding cost and performance factors, operational overhead, scalability, compliance, integration, and geographically diverse deployments.
- Vitess focus on MySQL helps ship stuff like database import functionality
