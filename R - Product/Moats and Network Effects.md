- **Indirect network effects** are a little more complicated. They occur in two-sided (or multi-sided) products where the size of one user group affects how valuable the product is to another user group.
- **data network effects**, describes products which become better with more users via the data those users generate.

	- **multihoming costs** explain how easy or likely it is to use multiple competing networks simultaneously.
