	- look at: https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/google-acquires-cloud-migration-platform-alooma/
	- my ideas
		- data error supporting - could use hashes 
		- entity regularizaciÃ³n
		- "white label integrations" - be clearbit for everyone else

	- ecommerce shitty? - low margin, fashion driven, adpocalypse
	- git proper
	- tinacms -> onpage editing
	- replatforming from adobe experience manager
	- api to have other access
	- ohad & dan -> AE, sales process

	- engineers hate making 1 day sale webpages
	- problem: lack of connectivity between nocode and real code
	- cant make a webflow frontend + shopify backend - not composable
	- "like coding" is not coding - not composable
	- solves:
		- marketing moves faster
		- perf problems (incl for a/b test and personalization)
		- coding genuinely democratized - nocode tool
	- qwik and partytown - more niche thing
	- goal is to do that with coding
	- needs:
		- made a killer product that solves a killer problem. but...
		- relatively unknown. people think we are just drag and drop
		- "we have a marketing team.. they dont understand developers"
		- recurring pattern - hard to find pple who know code n how devs think - leadership hole
		- 15-50 people - ceo too influential
		- 2 people doing devrel, no leadership
	- initial wedge: ecomm
		- frontend dev on public facing website - zapier, audience to convert - not internal tool
		- conferences, twitter, youtube
		- where are they - "vercel model"
			- focus on medium to large biz. small -> webflow
			- care about: load fast, fast to edit
			- investing in qwik/partytown
				- how to use adobe experience manager
				- growth strategy around getting adoption of qwik
				- build design systems and compose those
				- 10% resources. 
				- problem is awareness/adoption
			- misko not great content?
		- acv's 40k starting, then high NRR - 148%
			- meters: traffic and seats

	- 2nd meeting
		- https://vtex.com/us-en/cases/
		- infoworld top companies
			- vercel, cloudflare, builder
		- roleplay	
			- good things - partytown, qwik, mitosis
				- infoworld reporters reaching out
			- bad things
				- only get it 45 mins into conversation
				- nobody heard of us
					- tight group of people
					- developers matter
					- just good for the engineers
					- shocked that we have a scheduling feature - live at a certain time
			- talking points
				- connect codebase
				- own deploy
			- dev advocacy
				- content videos
					- https://www.linkedin.com/in/codingcatdev
				- technical writing
					- good
				- but low impact
		- misc discussion
			- nothing devs hate more than shipping something that goes immediately to trash
			- experimenting
			- bizdev with design systems https://mui.com/
		- macro trends
			- change in way people are making sites
				- jamstack -> 100m's of pageviews in 2014 with angular
				- cms - adobe experience manager - legacy bc blocking. now have to move 
					- edge segmentation
					- draggy droppy
				- headless commerce -> macro trend
			- reducing javascript - perf
				- have a perf tool to see no js that runs your site thru edge modifications
			- no code - webflow
				- hiring devs fcking impossible
				- pair builder with jr eng -> more productive
			- ecomm bloodbath
				- CAC going insanely high
				- much more experimentation
	- brent locks
		- sf, 8, 6, 3 -> m&a advisory -> wrong side of the table -> pict.com -> acquihired -> shopstyle -> rakuten - GM 700m revenue, 150people offices
		- builder - passionate about no code - learning (steve), not learning (brent)
			- steve joined -> shopstyle
			- replatformed to angular
			- headless site - cms -> contentful - handed it to marketing - fill in these forms -> good for 2 weeks -> "hey we need to move from shop to shop men shop women" - just want a hero element - why does it take 2 weeks- 2 pissed off teams - developers
			- "we built this page in webflow, cant we put it into the angular site?" - no
			- steve tried to figure it out - 2016-2017 - acquired by rakuten
			- first official customers of builder - sat with them for a year
			- more involved -> left and joined - seed from greylock
			- launch aug 2019 -> only in market for 2 years -> onboarded
			- jan 2020 2 people -> apr 2022 40-45 people
			- getting misko - partner at greylock https://greylock.com/portfolio-news/headless-no-code-commerce/
				- no code - "composable visual development" - stigma: not great code, not being great code
				- componentize the frontend - enough tooling involved for developers
				- pair programming on qwik
			- TAM
				- Gartner - agile CMS - Wordpress, contentful, adobe - >50b
				- (API first) Devtools - competing against a CMS - competing against building and maintaining a tool internally - 100b 
				- Downmarket -> lowcode/sitebuilding space (webflow) - 50b
			- further abstractions form complex software development - composability is the key piece
				- webflow is limited because limited to their stack
					- YC continuum fund in webflow - not worried about competition
				- jcrew estee lauder and fiverr
			- ecommerce iterations - 60%-70% of revenue online
				- 2xing online

explore
	- cloudflare
	- replay?
	- supabase?
	- suborbital?
		- democratize global by default compute - eg cf workers, deno
		- enable anybody to deploy one of these globaly distributed compute networks - deploy their own network
		- edge data plane - all the building blocks - own self operated edge network
		- "the hybrid compute company"
			- software dev framework and infra
			- deploy and span central cloud and edge cloud
			- we figure that out for you
			- efficient and secure and portable (deploy wherever)
		- benefits: latency.
		- pple love the idea of cf workers but are very constrained - very small subset of js, and subset of what wasm can do
		- alternative: open source, deployable
		- customers why dont like cf/aws
		  - vast codebases that aren't js
			- network topology - cf has lots of regions but you want to optimize
			- control of the network - privacy, security
					- healthcare, ecommerce co's
			- CF competitors - (fastly?)
		- comapred to deno a lot
			- global network deployed
			- catching up
			- js first class, but nto optimized for wasm
		- team
      - 2 dev advocates 1 tech writer
			- someone focused on strategy
			- making efforts cohesive - 1 demo/integrations, 1 video/livestream
			- keep them on structured framework/campaigns
			- written content vs documentation
		- challenges
			- wasm advocacy not just suborbital advocacy
			- edge computing, globally distributed computing
			- "we do a lot of stuff" - second product
			- educating pple what parts they should focus on
				- de emphasize: grab, vector
				- sat and atmo and sudocli -> 
				- compute product and edge product
			- wasm heating up quickly - get ahead of wave - seeing wave rising
				- product marketing to stay at the front of that wave
				- "wasmcloud" - dont want to steal their thunder
			- seed stage -> A stage
