	- engineers hate making 1 day sale webpages
	- problem: lack of connectivity between nocode and real code
	- cant make a webflow frontend + shopify backend - not composable
	- "like coding" is not coding - not composable
	- solves:
		- marketing moves faster
		- perf problems (incl for a/b test and personalization)
		- coding genuinely democratized - nocode tool
	- qwik and partytown - more niche thing
	- goal is to do that with coding
	- needs:
		- made a killer product that solves a killer problem. but...
		- relatively unknown. people think we are just drag and drop
		- "we have a marketing team.. they dont understand developers"
		- recurring pattern - hard to find pple who know code n how devs think - leadership hole
		- 15-50 people - ceo too influential
		- 2 people doing devrel, no leadership
	- initial wedge: ecomm
		- frontend dev on public facing website - zapier, audience to convert - not internal tool
		- conferences, twitter, youtube
		- where are they - "vercel model"
			- focus on medium to large biz. small -> webflow
			- care about: load fast, fast to edit
			- investing in qwik/partytown
				- how to use adobe experience manager
				- growth strategy around getting adoption of qwik
				- build design systems and compose those
				- 10% resources. 
				- problem is awareness/adoption

				- cms - adobe experience manager - legacy bc blocking. now have to move 
					- edge segmentation
					- draggy droppy
				- headless commerce -> macro trend
			- reducing javascript - perf
				- have a perf tool to see no js that runs your site thru edge modifications
			- no code - webflow
				- hiring devs fcking impossible
				- pair builder with jr eng -> more productive
			- ecomm bloodbath
				- CAC going insanely high
				- much more experimentation
	- brent locks
		- sf, 8, 6, 3 -> m&a advisory -> wrong side of the table -> pict.com -> acquihired -> shopstyle -> rakuten - GM 700m revenue, 150people offices
		- builder - passionate about no code - learning (steve), not learning (brent)
			- steve joined -> shopstyle
			- replatformed to angular
			- headless site - cms -> contentful - handed it to marketing - fill in these forms -> good for 2 weeks -> "hey we need to move from shop to shop men shop women" - just want a hero element - why does it take 2 weeks- 2 pissed off teams - developers
			- "we built this page in webflow, cant we put it into the angular site?" - no
			- steve tried to figure it out - 2016-2017 - acquired by rakuten
			- first official customers of builder - sat with them for a year
			- more involved -> left and joined - seed from greylock
			- launch aug 2019 -> only in market for 2 years -> onboarded
			- jan 2020 2 people -> apr 2022 40-45 people
			- getting misko - partner at greylock https://greylock.com/portfolio-news/headless-no-code-commerce/
				- no code - "composable visual development" - stigma: not great code, not being great code
				- componentize the frontend - enough tooling involved for developers
				- pair programming on qwik
			- TAM
				- Gartner - agile CMS - Wordpress, contentful, adobe - >50b
				- (API first) Devtools - competing against a CMS - competing against building and maintaining a tool internally - 100b 
				- Downmarket -> lowcode/sitebuilding space (webflow) - 50b
			- further abstractions form complex software development - composability is the key piece
				- webflow is limited because limited to their stack
					- YC continuum fund in webflow - not worried about competition
				- jcrew estee lauder and fiverr
			- ecommerce iterations - 60%-70% of revenue online

			- chat with alex and ersin
				- alex was fin
				- ersin - microsaas, tired of coding another marketing page
					- deep dive into builder
					- pissed off with documentation
					- 2 page forum post
					- steve emailed
					- speaks to inexperience
					- raw leadership
						- sarah - attuned at high level
						- main problem is awareness
						- establishing process, and cover
						- empathetic and understanding, personal rapport, doesnt micromanage
						- communicated v clearly not social copy all day long
					- what do you want to work on all day long
						- building out with people - discord, forums
						- creating demos
						- technical documentation
						- what devrel means to me - mental healthcare, tremendous joy in programming. human aspect of code 
						- "i see myself as a healer, as a safe space"
					- broader narrative - role has shifted into marketing
						- still on the founder path
						- learn marketing - but its not connecting to my soul
						- thats why "healer". "introspection". "therapy".
					- whatve you done
						- working on technical documentation. curmudgeonly - all the flaws
						- but i have more to me.
					- building community. "no code engineering"
						- graphic designer and frontend
						- defining a new segment of the job market
						- sub discipline of software eng
						- makerpad
						- react -> reactive programming, unidirectional flow of data

explore
	- crossplane
		- the multicloud future
			- 80b in 2020 - infra - ec2 etc
			- 1.5tr in 2027 - snowflake, databricks, elastic, mongodb
			- platform and infra services - gotto use best of breed services
		- massive gaps
			- time is split between working on service and integrating into the mothership
			- they come together using glue scripts, terraform, ansible, ops, hiring devops, sre, etc
		- everyone trying to build heroku. why dont we create a platform that lets you build your own heroku
			- console
			- cli
			- api
			- documentation
			- control plane
			- consuming backend services from aws etc
			- customizable cloud platform for their own use
		- similar: CRM - used oracle - coded your own java code
		- realization: have to start with open source control plane. best kept secret in cloud - popular in hyperscalers, not very popular in enterprise
		- oss governance, create 2 sided network -> vendors & users
			- every new cloud service - as part
			- hundreds of production deployments
			- how much going thru crossplane
		- part eng, organizational, foundation, devrel, community
		- GOAL: all 1.5tr
		- people resist being commoditized - represent them 1:1 - its not a problem for aws
		- 3 of top 8 accounts at aws - only use crossplane
		- 90% custs AWS
		- k8s api but not k8s dependent
			- k8s did 2 things: 
			- container orchestration war
				- won: control plane for 	containers
				- built a better control plane for docker than docker did
			- took control plane and made it extensible
			- bassem worked on brook - control plane for storage
			- inside of a k8s project
		- upbound?
			- crossplane is a framework for building ctrl plane
			- upbound is a product that lets u DIY heroku that uses ctrl planes
			- a set of management services
			- IAM is to aws - cloudtrail, audit trail, logging, console, cli's, apis
			- year 3
		- control planes are a generational leap from infra as code
			- terraform is at end of its cycle
			- pulumi hitching on - diff engine, apply, drift world
		- chat with sumbry
			- airbnb
				- some director of eng
				- https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumbry/
				- built own platform with k8s - a whole interface called onetouch - abstract away
				- amount of context needed was insane
			- uber
				- reliability
				- believer in cadence
			- twilio
				- platform team at twlo
				- when you joined twlo you had to be part of the telcom space
				- moved to bay area for it
				- started to get it for texting - but actually cloud comms api, and it was the platform
				- it was developer evangelist group
			- why crossplane
				- control plane tech
				- what are all the applications we have for this
			- challenges: need to continue building out the upbound product, but also do education about the space
				- custs: how do i best use this
				- evangelism - new product
				- building stuff for 2 sets of custs
				- takes 3 months to get really good at it
				![[Pasted image 20220420212254.png]]
				- 4 concepts
					- universal api <- start here
					- composable resources
						- make arbitrary api's/resources
							- give you ability to easily mode
						- app store for the cloud
						- like a whole marketplace
						- databases, logging systems, pricing
					- universal packages
					- crossplane control plane
				- k8s vs crossplane - unopinionated
					- xplane is not a platform, we give you the ability to become a platform
				- use this tech to build your own platform
				- build a lot of powerful stuff on top of api
					- building resource discovery system
					- can talk to k8s api - to commercial product 
				- xplane framework created around k8s - makes it easy to have a console, cli, etc
					- directly use kubectl to see status
				- mgmt services - what we are now building for upbound 2.0
					- if xplane is a framework, anytime you need to support sth new eg. bringing your own secret store
					- create extension points to xplane itself
					- lots of different integrations
					- open observability system 
					- low level 
					- one of the risk of the company is someone coming along with higher level stuff
				- even with UIs you can annotate
				- support - control
			- standalone product and cloud product as well
				- host and run all control planes
				- agent that you may run in a cluster <- upbound 2 agent
				- no visibility into anything else at all
			- wants: keep swapping out different components they need
			- stuff you dont do?
				- having a box of lego bricks
				- doesnt have any instructions
				- reference any instructions
			- he asked me what you think the role is
				- community
				- registry
					- otel system
			- demo of product doing something
				- twlo - 5mins -> get it down - create use resources
			- heroku -> shipyard
			- ![[Pasted image 20220420214917.png]]
			- use cases
				- manage k8s
				- developerportals
				- cloud aggregation
					- see all resources across cloud env
			- 5k community, 3k followers, 3k slack
				- ![[Pasted image 20220420215026.png]]
			- how to add support into xplane for anything
			- its an abstraction layer for anything with a public api
				- its SaaS companies - you can model twlo with xplane
				- its hybrid cloud - anything with a public api
				- configure the whole IT stack for a company
	- cloudflare
	- replay?
	- supabase?
	- suborbital?
		- democratize global by default compute - eg cf workers, deno
		- enable anybody to deploy one of these globaly distributed compute networks - deploy their own network
		- edge data plane - all the building blocks - own self operated edge network
		- "the hybrid compute company"
			- software dev framework and infra
			- deploy and span central cloud and edge cloud
			- we figure that out for you
			- efficient and secure and portable (deploy wherever)
		- benefits: latency.
		- pple love the idea of cf workers but are very constrained - very small subset of js, and subset of what wasm can do
		- alternative: open source, deployable
		- customers why dont like cf/aws
		  - vast codebases that aren't js
			- network topology - cf has lots of regions but you want to optimize
			- control of the network - privacy, security
					- healthcare, ecommerce co's
			- CF competitors - (fastly?)
		- comapred to deno a lot
			- global network deployed
			- catching up
			- js first class, but nto optimized for wasm
		- team
      - 2 dev advocates 1 tech writer
			- someone focused on strategy
			- making efforts cohesive - 1 demo/integrations, 1 video/livestream
			- keep them on structured framework/campaigns
			- written content vs documentation
		- challenges
			- wasm advocacy not just suborbital advocacy
			- edge computing, globally distributed computing
			- "we do a lot of stuff" - second product
			- educating pple what parts they should focus on
				- de emphasize: grab, vector
				- sat and atmo and sudocli -> 
				- compute product and edge product
			- wasm heating up quickly - get ahead of wave - seeing wave rising
				- product marketing to stay at the front of that wave
				- "wasmcloud" - dont want to steal their thunder
			- seed stage -> A stage

	- 5tran AND airbyte. 
	- builder.io
		- frontend?
		- Series A
	- $1 in snowflake - 5% in dbt, 5% in fivetran
	- buf.build - unique asset
		- ?
	- chronosphere.io - next gen monitoring
		- nobody built cloud native k8s monitoring solution - not built for scale and cardinality. HUGE DEMAND
		- grafana vs chronosphere.
			- not winners: ddog, signalfx
		- unmet demand for this category
	- huggingface
		- no deep IP
		- no on operational complexity
		- 20/10 on community
		- theyre in the content curation business
		- fastest growing company. most strategic asset in all of ML
		- weak on product
		- no enterprise motion today. 0 to 10 last year. no competition.
		- CNCF angle
		- julien
			- transformers -> from dep learning, to audio, RL
			- transformer architecture really central to ML
			- huggingface hub
			- still early but faster acceleration
			- seriesC
			- social network, collab layer
			- 10yr
			- ML as big as software eng
			- what are pple paying for 
				- monetization will change 
				- right now a lot of enterprise custs - intel, qualcomm, etc - chips for ai - want pulse on the community
				- experimenting with private model hub
				- self serve saas product
				- still learning
				- intuition: when platform is much bigger - control of collab layer of ml - wont monetize collab layer - but seamless integration
				- cloud distros - github couldve been gateway to frontend - wouldnt need to login to aws
			- main barriers to get there
				- build - interaction with community
				- what has worked?
				- hasnt been easy way to share NN models in the past - bc large files
				- transformers
				- gh -> visualizing layers of model, demos of models, streamlit
				- acquired - gradial -> simpler streamlit
					- pete pngwn
				- talked about simon willison datasette
			- still 1% of the way making ML truly accessible to a lot of people
				- big challenge making ML as simple as possible for SWEs
				- ideas
	- any successful company
		- deep IP
		- can you simplify operational complexity
		- go to mkt/community wedge
	- databases
	- operating systems
