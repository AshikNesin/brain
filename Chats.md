	- look at: https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/google-acquires-cloud-migration-platform-alooma/
	- my ideas
		- data error supporting - could use hashes 
		- entity regularizaciÃ³n
		- "white label integrations" - be clearbit for everyone else

	- biggest cms company?
	- ecommerce shitty? - low margin, fashion driven, adpocalypse
	- git proper
	- tinacms -> onpage editing
	- replatforming from adobe experience manager
	- api to have other access
	- ohad & dan -> AE, sales process

	- engineers hate making 1 day sale webpages
	- problem: lack of connectivity between nocode and real code
	- cant make a webflow frontend + shopify backend - not composable
	- "like coding" is not coding - not composable
	- solves:
		- marketing moves faster
		- perf problems (incl for a/b test and personalization)
		- coding genuinely democratized - nocode tool
	- qwik and partytown - more niche thing
	- goal is to do that with coding
	- needs:
		- made a killer product that solves a killer problem. but...
		- relatively unknown. people think we are just drag and drop
		- "we have a marketing team.. they dont understand developers"
		- recurring pattern - hard to find pple who know code n how devs think - leadership hole
		- 15-50 people - ceo too influential
		- 2 people doing devrel, no leadership
	- initial wedge: ecomm
		- frontend dev on public facing website - zapier, audience to convert - not internal tool
		- conferences, twitter, youtube
		- where are they - "vercel model"
			- focus on medium to large biz. small -> webflow
			- care about: load fast, fast to edit
			- investing in qwik/partytown
				- how to use adobe experience manager
				- growth strategy around getting adoption of qwik
				- build design systems and compose those
				- 10% resources. 
				- problem is awareness/adoption
			- misko not great content?
		- acv's 40k starting, then high NRR

		- democratize global by default compute - eg cf workers, deno
		- enable anybody to deploy one of these globaly distributed compute networks - deploy their own network
		- edge data plane - all the building blocks - own self operated edge network
		- "the hybrid compute company"
			- software dev framework and infra
			- deploy and span central cloud and edge cloud
			- we figure that out for you
			- efficient and secure and portable (deploy wherever)
		- benefits: latency.
		- pple love the idea of cf workers but are very constrained - very small subset of js, and subset of what wasm can do
		- alternative: open source, deployable
		- customers why dont like cf/aws
		  - vast codebases that aren't js
			- network topology - cf has lots of regions but you want to optimize
			- control of the network - privacy, security
					- healthcare, ecommerce co's
			- CF competitors - (fastly?)
		- comapred to deno a lot
			- global network deployed
			- catching up
			- js first class, but nto optimized for wasm
		- team
      - 2 dev advocates 1 tech writer
			- someone focused on strategy
			- making efforts cohesive - 1 demo/integrations, 1 video/livestream
			- keep them on structured framework/campaigns
			- written content vs documentation
		- challenges
			- wasm advocacy not just suborbital advocacy
			- edge computing, globally distributed computing
			- "we do a lot of stuff" - second product
			- educating pple what parts they should focus on
				- de emphasize: grab, vector
				- sat and atmo and sudocli -> 
				- compute product and edge product
			- wasm heating up quickly - get ahead of wave - seeing wave rising
				- product marketing to stay at the front of that wave
				- "wasmcloud" - dont want to steal their thunder
			- seed stage -> A stage
