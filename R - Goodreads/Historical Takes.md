In 1901, two years before helping build the first heavier-than-air flyer, Wilbur Wright told his brother that powered flight was [fifty years away](https://books.google.com/books?id=ldxfLyNIk9wC&pg=PA91&dq=%22i+said+to+my+brother+orville%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwioiseChcnWAhWL-VQKHab6AqMQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=%22i%20said%20to%20my%20brother%20orville%22&f=false).

In 1939, three years before he personally oversaw the first critical chain reaction in a pile of uranium bricks, Enrico Fermi voiced [90% confidence](https://books.google.com/books?id=aSgFMMNQ6G4C&pg=PA813&lpg=PA813&dq=weart+fermi&source=bl&ots=Jy1pBOUL10&sig=c9wK_yLHbXZS_GFIv0K3bgpmE58&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNofKsisnWAhXGlFQKHbOSB1QQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%22ten%20per%20cent%22&f=false) that it was [impossible](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/h8m/being_halfrational_about_pascals_wager_is_even/) to use uranium to sustain a fission chain reaction. I believe Fermi also said a year after that, aka two years before the denouement, that _if_ net power from fission was even possible (as he then granted some greater plausibility) then it would be fifty years off; but for this I neglected to keep the citation.

And of course if you're not the Wright Brothers or Enrico Fermi, you will be even more surprised. Most of the world learned that atomic weapons were now a thing when they woke up to the headlines about Hiroshima. T

- In 1970, Marvin Minsky, recipient of the Turing Award (“the Nobel Prize of Computing”), predicted that within “three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being.”  https://mindmatters.ai/2022/01/will-chatbots-replace-the-art-of-human-conversation/

- The original laptop computer was the size of a briefcase that weighed 40 pounds. And it had, like, a four-inch screen. And an early review in the New York Times said, basically, This is a niche product. Who on Earth is going to carry a 40-pound brick home? The guy actually wrote, “I can’t imagine the average user taking one along when going fishing.” They just didn’t envision the engineering that would shrink it into what we have today.
