Originals

- If the First Age was about building out a language, and the Second Age was about users exploring and expanding the language, the Third Age is about clearing away legacy assumptions and collapsing layers of tooling.
- In summary: Third Age JS tools will be
	-   Faster
	-   ESM first
	-   Collapsed Layers (One thing doing many things well instead of many things doing one thing well)
	-   Typesafe-er (built with a strongly typed language at core, and supporting TS in user code with zero config)
	-   Secure-er (from dependency attacks, or lax permissions)
	-   Polyglot
	-   Neo-Isomorphic (recognizing that much, if not most, JS should run first at buildtime or on server-side before ever reaching the client)
- The result of all of this work is **both a better developer experience** (faster builds, industry standard tooling) and **user experience** (smaller bundles, faster feature delivery). It is the final metamorphosis of JavaScript from site scripting toy language to full application platform.
