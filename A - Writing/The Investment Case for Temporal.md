# The Investment Case for Temporal

I spend a lot of time talking to developers about Temporal, but haven't touched on Temporal's business potential since my [Why Temporal](https://www.swyx.io/why-temporal/#the-business-case-for-temporal) post from last year. 

Today is the occasion of [our Series B announcement](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1493994119869657090), and I thought it'd be fun to take my dev hat off and put on my money hat. I won't be discussing "[So what actually is Temporal?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30365798)" here, just making the business case that I would as a venture partner getting buy-in to invest in the company.

*obviously this is personal speculation and I am not confirming the company roadmap or anything. This is going to start off sounding extremely bullish, because it is easy to do that for young startups, but this isn't a puff piece and we'll get more skeptical towards the end.*

## Why Temporal is worth 1.5b

### Unicorn by Comparables

Making a unicorn valuation by comps is the easiest, if flimsiest, argument.

Some notable recent raises by peer devtools, compared with informal data on their revenue trends, gives us confidence that Temporal is in the neighborhood of similar raises:

- [Chronosphere raised 200m on $1+b](https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/chronosphere-raises-200m-at-a-1b-valuation-for-cloud-native-monitoring-adds-granular-distributed-tracing-to-its-dashboard/)
- [Sourcegraph raised 125m on $2.6b](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/sourcegraph-raises-125m-series-d-on-2-6b-valuation-for-universal-code-search-tool/)
- [Airbyte raised 150m on $1.5b](https://airbyte.com/blog/a-150m-series-b-to-power-the-movement-of-data)

### Unicorn by Growth

Making a unicorn value based on *fundamentals* is a good deal harder. Let's just say exit price/sales multiples for enterprise software is at 20-40x. So Temporal would have to bring in $50m in revenue (with say 30-40% growth) for $1.5b valuation to make sense as a standalone public company. It does not make that today, no unicorn does. But growth is a good deal higher. What’s a fair price for $5m revenue growing the classic “triple triple double double” for example? Thats the sort of handicapping you have to do in startup investing.

However one thing I can say here is to collate public statements on the *viral expansion* of Temporal:

- **At Uber**, Cadence grew from 0 to >100 usecases within 3 years.
- Also while [at Uber](https://docs.temporal.io/blog/oss-startups-podcast), Cadence got adoption at HashiCorp, Coinbase, DoorDash, Box, Checkr on the back of [minimal (but effective) marketing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJwFxqdSx4Y)
- Temporal open source has disclosed [25% MoM growth](https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/16/temporal_103m_funding/) (which annualizes to about [14x in 1 yr](https://twitter.com/BogieBalkansky/status/1494025245279195136) ) in active clusters
- [Datadog reported](https://docs.temporal.io/blog/how-datadog-ensures-database-reliability-with-temporal/) usage "expanded to more than 100 users across dozens of teams within just one year" now running [3 million workflows per month](https://youtu.be/Hz7ZZzafBoE?t=100)
- [Netflix reported](https://youtu.be/LliBP7YMGyA?t=197) running 500k workflows a *day* in Oct 2021 and projected 1m a day by end 2021
- [Stripe hasn't disclosed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Crkcr1S-NSc) any numbers, but have posted [a second job for their Workflow Engine team](https://stripe.com/jobs/listing/infrastructure-engineer-developer-productivity-workflow-engine/2964407) this year.

The natural position of Temporal as a primary tool for the rising [Platform Engineer](https://twitter.com/danielbryantuk/status/1494614250567966732) to provide an independently scalable stateful reliability primitive (bundling queues, databases, timers, gateways, encryption etc.) means that the biggest cost of adoption is paid by the first user. Every subsequent user after that has a much lower cost to  

At minimum this should mean that user acquisition/organic growth should be strong for several years, and in terms of monetization it's quite possible to see Net Dollar Retention north of 200% in the first few years of implementation, which is world-beating.
