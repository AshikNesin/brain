Naval Ravikant's most famous writing is [How to Get Rich (without getting lucky)](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936?lang=en). He spends 12 out of 38 tweets discussing the importance of **leverage** in building wealth:

> "Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media)... Code and media are permissionless leverage. Theyâ€™re the leverage behind the newly rich. **You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.**"

Naval was writing for a general audience, but I think this point bears further elaboration for *the software engineers*. I've already written about the media side of this as [Friendcatchers](https://www.swyx.io/friendcatchers), but as far as I can tell nobody's taken a crack at extending the wealth leverage concept for software.

The reason this matters is that all software is not created equal. Choosing to work very hard on the wrong thing caps your financial upside from the get-go. Therefore every ambitious software engineer needs a *Theory of Value of Software*, and to make learning, career, and investment choices accordingly.

I listened to [the audiobook version](https://www.navalmanack.com/audiobook) of the Alamanack of Naval Ravikant, just Part 1 on Wealth. It has two sections, Building Wealth and Building Judgment.
