# swyx's second brain

this is my public obsidian store of resources and lists and stuff, available on:

- Github: https://github.com/sw-yx/brain (PRs welcome)
- Obsidian: https://publish.obsidian.md/swyx

i used to make a bunch of separate lists but am now just consolidating them under one repo.

## User Guide

- I will rearrange and rename at any time with no notice
- The folders are named in [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) format - optimizing for:
	- P - nearterm projects i want to do
	- A - standards i want to upkeep
	- R - resources for stuff i like
	- Archive - for misc past junk i dont see myself needing anymore
	- not everything is public, sorry if your thing isn't on here
