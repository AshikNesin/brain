## ⚛️ Concurrent-React-Notes

Welcome to `concurrent-react-notes` - a great place to learn about Concurrent React!

> If you are looking for notes from before the launch of Concurrent React at ReactConf 2019, see the [/legacy](/legacy/README.md) folder.

Everything here is information since launch, assuming you have seen the official introductory talks from the React team and [read the official docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html).

These are personal notes, so they _will_ have an editorial bias. But you are welcome to open issues, contribute, and discuss with me.

## Suspense

Here are the concerns solved by Suspense:

- Single declarative way to specify loading states decoupled from _what_ is loading (GraphQL, REST, JS bundle, images) and where in the tree
- Graceful orchestration of those loading states (control over reveal order, avoiding flicker)
