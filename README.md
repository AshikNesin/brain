# swyx's second brain

this is my obsidian store of resources and lists and stuff.

i used to make a bunch of separate lists but am now just consolidating them under one repo.

there is no explicit licensing on this because these are personal notes - you are welcome to read them, contribute to them, suggest additions - just do not copy them and share them as your own.
