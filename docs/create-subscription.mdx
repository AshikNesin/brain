# `create-subscription`

create-subscription is a utility for subscribing to external data sources inside React components. It is officially supported and maintained by the React team.

> When should you NOT use this?

This utility should be used for subscriptions to a single value that are typically only read in one place and may update frequently (e.g. a component that subscribes to a geolocation API to show a dot on a map).


But please see their readme for usage examples: https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/create-subscription#limitations-in-async-mode
