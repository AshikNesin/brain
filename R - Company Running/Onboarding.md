Welcome to Airbyte!  We are incredibly excited to have you join us.

This is a new hire onboarding plan, a self-directed learning tool, designed to guide you through your first 60-90 days at Airbyte. It will help you meet key individuals, understand our business and identify the things you need to know and learn in order to hit the ground running. Remember, this is an onboarding plan designed to get you started and should not limit you from any other initiatives or ideas.

# Onboarding Buddy

Your manager has selected a fellow team member who is very familiar with your new role and is available to answer your questions about Airbyte as they come up. Your buddy will schedule an intro call during your first week, and you can schedule recurring meetings as needed after that.

Your onboarding buddy is: **[buddy name] (optional: link to buddy’s how to work with me guide)**

# Manager

Your manager will be **[manager name]**. During your first meeting make sure to schedule recurring 1:1s with them. **[Link to your how to work with me guide and anything else you think would be beneficial to share here.]**
