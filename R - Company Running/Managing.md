## giving feedback

- manager tools - giving effective feedback
	- bad managers give specifics on success/failure - there is nothing you can do about stuff that passed
	- punishment doesnt work - it causes future avoidance of punishment - people do same thing wrong again then spend time covering up/not communicating
	- praise is fine, but doesnt work. tell people what you want more of, specifically what she did that can be repeated
	- productive employees are much happier than unprod employees
		- happiness does not drive productivity at all
		- its the other way around
	- only reason to talk is to encourage behavior that makes them more effective in the future
- Hey X can I give you some feedback? When you do X, Y happens. Thank you, or can you do that differently.
- "can i make an observation?" -> 
- give it early - dont wait for repeated iterations
