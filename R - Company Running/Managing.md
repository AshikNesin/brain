## giving feedback

- manager tools - giving effective feedback
	- bad managers give specifics on success/failure - there is nothing you can do about stuff that passed
	- punishment doesnt work - it causes future avoidance of punishment - people do same thing wrong again then spend time covering up/not communicating
	- praise is fine, but doesnt work. tell people what you want more of, specifically what she did that can be repeated
	- productive employees are much happier than unprod employees
		- happiness does not drive productivity at all
		- its the other way around
	- only reason to talk is to encourage behavior that makes them more effective in the future
- feedback should be like breathing - casual, not a big deal
	- like driving feedback
- Step 1 - ASK
	- Hey X can I give you some feedback? When you do X, Y happens. Thank you, or can you do that differently.
	- "can i make an observation?" -> 
	- give it early - dont wait for repeated iterations
		- sooner the better
	- MAKE SURE THEY ARE READY
		- never ask directs a question whose answer you dont intend to honor - because otherwise they will just always assume you will use Role Power
		- the direct contols their future behavior, not you
		- direct should not be distracted. make sure they are ready to listen.
		- give feedback within a week. only teh most recent offense
	- give more positive than negative feedback
- step 2 - WHEN YOU did this
	- dont make it about your intepretation of what they did
	- not about their motivation or intention
	- **make it about behavior** - cannot argue with
	- NOT "I feel" etc -> thats psychologists dealing with mental illness? - the direct begins to make the problem about you
	- 5 behaviors
		- words you say
		- how you say
		- facial expressions
		- work product - quantity, quality, accuracy, timeliness
- step 3 - HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS - the outcome that i know - describe the impact
	- when ur late, product is delayed, etc
	- often done with 2 together
	- describe impact on you as the manager
- Step 4 - negative feedback, or encouraging behavior
	- "can you work on that?" "can you change that?"
	- more casualness = not in trouble
	- dont tell them what to do differently - they may disagree
	- have them come up with the adjustment 
- misc
	- we havent done it that way before/previous manager
		- that makes sense why you do that, but i'm changing that
		- will you commit to it
	- i have other stuff to do/i dont want to
	- i'll think about it/i'll try
		- its rude - i've asked you to change - i think its reasonable, are you gonna change it
		- i cant make you change - if i dont see change, we're gonna be back at this feedback convo
		- in 3 weeks if you dont come to any more meetings we're back in the same boat
	- say yes, but dont change
		- just give feedback repeatedly - about 3-4 times
		- stage 2 feedback - dont mention you talked about this before
			- i question you ahve a willingness to change
			- if you do waht you commit to
		- not part of the formal discipline procedure
	- everybody wants to be praised differently
	- DISC https://www.peoplebank.com/pbank/owa/pbk00w01.DisplayHelpWindow?p_nSBId=1000&p_sHelpId=disc_expl_pp
		- D - dominant - task focused
		- I - Influence - people focused
		- S - Steadiness - supportive
		- C - Compliance
