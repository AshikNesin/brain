## General Technical Audiences

-   1 sentence
    -   "Temporal is the open source microservices orchestration platform for running mission critical code at any scale."
-   30 second (from [Charles + Liang](https://temporaltechnologies.slack.com/archives/C025MMBNTEV/p1644359403801589))
    -   "Temporal is an open source platform that transparently manages software application state at scale, making it more reliable to run, more productive to evolve and easier to operate. Developers interact with Temporal entirely as code so it fits in your existing architecture, development and deployment decisions. Developed from over a decade of experience at Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Uber, Temporal is used in production by the world's most innovative companies like Snapchat, Netflix, Instacart and Stripe.‚Äù
